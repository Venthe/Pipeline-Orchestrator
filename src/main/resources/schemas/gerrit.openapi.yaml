    Provides a portal into the major events occurring on the server, outputting activity data in real-time to the client. Events are filtered by the caller`s access permissions, ensuring the caller only receives events for changes they can view on the web, or in the project repository.

    Event output is in JSON, one event per line.

        "400 Bad Request" is returned if the request is not understood by the server due to malformed syntax.
        E.g. "400 Bad Request" is returned if JSON input is expected but the 'Content-Type' of the request is not 'application/json' or the request body doesn’t contain valid JSON.
        "400 Bad Request" is also returned if required input fields are not set or if options are set which cannot be used together.
    "403":
      description: >
        "403 Forbidden" is returned if the operation is not allowed because the calling user does not have sufficient permissions.
        E.g. some REST endpoints require that the calling user has certain global capabilities assigned.
        "403 Forbidden" is also returned if self is used as account ID and the REST call was done without authentication.
    "404":
      description: >
        "404 Not Found" is returned if the resource that is specified by the URL is not found or is not visible to the calling user. A resource cannot be found if the URL contains a non-existing ID or view.
    "405":
      description: >
        "405 Method Not Allowed" is returned if the resource exists but doesn’t support the operation.
        E.g. some of the /groups/ endpoints are only supported for Gerrit internal groups; if they are invoked for an external group the response is "405 Method Not Allowed".
    "409":
      description: >
        "409 Conflict" is returned if the request cannot be completed because the current state of the resource doesn’t allow the operation.
        E.g. if you try to submit a change that is abandoned, this fails with "409 Conflict" because the state of the change doesn’t allow the submit operation.
        "409 Conflict" is also returned if you try to create a resource but the name is already occupied by an existing resource.
    "412":

        The WebLinkInfo entity describes a link to an external site. Depending on the context and the provided data the UI may decide to show the link as a text link, a linkified icon, or both.

        If the tooltip is not provided, then the UI may fall back to showing something like "Open in External Tool".

        Weblinks will always be opened in a new tab.

        Identifier that uniquely identifies one account.
        
        This can be:
            self or me for the calling user
            a bare account ID ("18419")
            an account ID following a name in parentheses ("Full Name (18419)")
            a string of the format "Full Name <email@example.com>"
            just the email address ("email@example")
            a full name ("Full Name")
            a user name ("username")
        
        In all cases, accounts that are not visible to the calling user are not considered.
        
        In all cases except a bare account ID and self/me, inactive accounts are not considered. Inactive accounts should only be referenced by bare ID.
        
        If the input is a bare account ID, this will always resolve to exactly one account if there is a visible account with that ID, and zero accounts otherwise. (This is true even in corner cases like a user having a full name which is exactly a numeric account ID belonging to a different user; such a user cannot be identified by this number.)
        
        If the identifier is ambiguous or only refers to inactive accounts, the error message from the API should contain a human-readable description of how to disambiguate the request.

        Note: Except as noted above, callers should not rely on the particular priorities of any of the identifiers in the account resolution algorithm. Any other formats may be subject to future deprecation. If callers require specific searching semantics, they should use the Query Account endpoint to resolve a string to one or more accounts, then access the API using the account ID.
