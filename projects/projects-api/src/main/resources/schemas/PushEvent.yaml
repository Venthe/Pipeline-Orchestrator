  This event occurs when there is a push to a repository branch. This includes when a commit is pushed, when a commit tag is pushed, when a branch is deleted, when a tag is deleted, or when a repository is created from a template. To subscribe to only branch and tag deletions, use the delete webhook event.
  
  To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least read-level access for the "Contents" repository permission.

  Note: An event will not be created when more than three tags are pushed at once.
